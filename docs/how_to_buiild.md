## How to build

To build the project, you can just build with `ng build` command, however, we implemented one build for each environment. You can build with the following commands:


```bash
# Default build
ng build

# Run angular app in "development environment"
npm run build-dev

# Run angular app in "staging environment"
npm run build-stg

# Run angular app in "production environment"
npm run build-prd
```
